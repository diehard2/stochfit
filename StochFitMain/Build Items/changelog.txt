Version 1.5

    Change Log

	* versions 1.3 and 1.4 were internal
	* Updated levmar to version 2.2 - several very small bugs fixed 
	* Updated itextsharp to version 4.0.8
	* Added ED graph for model dependent fitting
	* Fixed pdf report and added more information for model dependent fits
	* Mastergraph now has publication quality graphs with transparency for overlaying
	* default points per Angstrom is now 3
	* default amount of subphase length is 40
	* default fitness function is log error
	* Fixed incorrect absorption calculation
	* added option for debugging
	* added adaptive ability to STUN to the GUI
	* separated STUN and SA dialogs
	* choice of tunneling algorithms
	* numerous small bug fixes
	* Can resume between runs
	* Improved error handling
	* Fitting from previous versions cannot be resumed.
	* calculation ~ 21% faster for absorbing films and ~ 12% faster for non absorbing under standard parameters
	* larger super and subphases for very rough films affect the calculation less
	* Fixed SLD calculator error with using bulk densities (thanks Luka)
	* Added XR only option to reject fits with negative electron density
	* Negative points in the data file are now ignored, and those files now load
	* Fixed problem with loading the data files when there are extra lines at the end
	* fitness scores are now divided by the number of data points
	* fixed localization issues. Now our European, South American, and Indian friends can fit data without problems
	* fixed graph issues
	* cleaned up statistical error issues
	* cleaned up file names and locations. Instead of deleting old fits, they are moved to a new folder

Version 1.2 - 10/31/2007

    Change Log

	* IMPORTANT - You will not be able to resume runs created with previous versions.
	* Renamed the project to StochFit. This better captures the nature of the algorithms.
	* Implemented consistent Chi square values throughout StochFit. Previously the Chi square reported in the model independent screen was the fit function, which was not necessarily a Chi square . The reflectivity Chi square values are reduced Chi squares of R/Rf. The Chi square of the electron density profile fit is just a least squares difference as there are no errors in that case.
	* Improved graph zoom behavior when errors are very large.
	* More options for the objective function in the model independent fit. 
	* Updated pdf and graphing library libraries.
	* Added Simulated Annealing and Stochastic Tunneling optimization algorithms for model independent fits. These are slower but more effective for finding alternate solutions
	* Small optimization algorithm improvements including the ability to easily resume from annealing
	* Increased speed of the model independent algorithm (depending on options and hardware) between 15 and 300 percent.
	* Better random number generation and behavior.
	* Fixed stochastic model dependent fit crash on multi processor systems.
	* Improved cutting and pasting of graphs

Version 1.1 - 10/1/2007

    Change Log

	* Fixed pdf report parameters to be consistent
	* Added Levenberg-Marquardt fit convergence details
	* Fixed error estimation problem
	* Model dependent box fit with constraints is now available
